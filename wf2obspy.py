# module for AEC researchers to import waveform data from local servers to an obspy stream

'''
DESCRIPTION:

    wf2obspy is a module containing a single function, get_waveforms. This function accesses seismic waveform data
    via nfs mounts from AEC's server Helium and a diskstation, taking it out of the antelope datascope database in which
    it is normally stored and making it accessible to the much more user-friendly, pythonic, and feature-rich obspy
    toolset. This function has been modeled after the behavior of obspy's get_waveforms (documentation can be found here:
    https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.clients.fdsn.client.Client.get_waveforms.html), but instead of downloading
    the data from the fdsn client, it imports the data from local servers at the GI.

USAGE:

    To use this module, place it in the same directory as the client code or configure a PYTHONPATH environment variable
    to make it accessible from elsewhere. Then, it can be imported and used in either of these two ways:

    import wf2obspy
    wf2obspy.get_waveforms()
    
    from wf2obspy import get_waveforms
    get_waveforms()

INPUTS:

    get_waveforms takes six parameters, and none of them are optional. network, station, location, and channel can all
    be passed either a string or a list to specify one or more of each parameter. Using network as an example, all of the 
    following formats are accepted for all of these parameters: "AK", "AK, AV", "AK,AV", ["AK"], ["AK", "AV"]. Additionally, 
    the UNIX-style wildcards * and ? can be used for these four parameters, where * matches any string and ? matches any 
    one character.

    network:
        A network code or list of network codes. Common examples are AK for AEC sites, CN for Canadian sites, AV for AVO
        sites, or IM for military sites.

    station:
        A station code or list of station codes, generally 3-5 characters in length. Some examples are COLA, POKR, or BAT.
        AEC's network map can be found here for more stations and their network codes: https://earthquake.alaska.edu/network

    location:
        A loc code or location code which can be used to differentiate between two of the same type of sensor at a 
        given site. Generally it is a number, two characters long such as 00 or 01. For most purposes, the * wildcard can be
        passed for location to just get all available data.

    channel:
        A sensor channel or list of channels which generally indicates what type of sensor and/or what axis on the sensor
        the waveform is from. Use of wildcards is helpful for this parameter as well, as instead of listing all three axes
        for a sensor (such as "BHE, BHN, BHZ") you could specify "BH?".

    starttime:
        This should be an obspy UTCDateTime object specifying the desired start time of the waveforms.
        (docs here: https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime.html#obspy.core.utcdatetime.UTCDateTime)

    endtime:
        This should be an obspy UTCDateTime object specifying the desired end time of the waveforms.

OUTPUTS:

    get_waveforms returns an obspy Stream object (docs here: https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.stream.Stream.html)
    containing some number of obspy traces (docs here: 
    https://docs.obspy.org/packages/autogen/obspy.core.trace.Trace.html#obspy.core.trace.Trace) determined by the inputs and the 
    data availability. All combinations of the provided networks, stations, locations, and channels will be attempted, and a 
    trace will be present in the returned Stream for each combination for which there was waveform data in the database.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:

    The system running the calling code must have antelope's software suite installed. At the time of writing this module,
    antelope 5.12 was being used, and compatibility with any past or future versions cannot be guaranteed. 

    The system must have the obspy and numpy packages available.
    
    The system must also have the appropriate nfs mounts from AEC's servers, which will make waveform data available. This can 
    be verified by running "dbe /aec/db/waveforms/YYYY_MM/waveforms_YYYY_MM_DD.wfdisc", where YYYY MM and DD are replaced with 
    appropriate date information for the waveforms being acquired, then clicking graphics->waveforms and zooming in with 
    shift-click until waveforms are visible. If you encounter an error, or lack of waveforms at any point in that process, 
    contact the AEC systems team for assistance.

    The system must also of course have python3 installed.

EXAMPLES:

    s1 = UTCDateTime("2022-10-01 23:59:00")
    duration = 180

     st = wf2obspy.get_waveforms("IM", "BC01,BC02,BC03,BC04,BC05", "*", "*", s1, s1+duration, dbname)

    st = wf2obspy.get_waveforms("IM", "BC01,BC02,BC03,BC04,BC05", "*", "*", s1, s1+duration)

    st = wf2obspy.get_waveforms("IM", "BC*", "*", "*", s1, s1+duration)

    st = wf2obspy.get_waveforms("IM, AV, AK", "BC*, IL*, COLD", "*", "*Z", s1, s1+duration)

    st = wf2obspy.get_waveforms("*", ["BAE", "BAW", "PS11", "PS12", "VMT"], "*", "LHZ", s1, s1+duration)

    st = wf2obspy.get_waveforms("AK", "MCAR,PTPK,BARN,BAL", "*", "BHZ", s1, s1+duration)

    st = wf2obspy.get_waveforms("AK", ["MCAR","PTPK","BARN","BAL"], "*", "BHZ", s1, s1+duration)]
